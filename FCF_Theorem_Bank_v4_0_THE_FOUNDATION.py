FCF THEOREM BANK -- v4.0.0
================================================================================

All theorems of the Foundational Constraint Framework.
Self-contained: stdlib only (math, fractions, dataclasses). Zero external deps.

SINGLE-AXIOM FORM (Paper 61):
  ONE axiom:  A1  (Finite Enforceability)
  TWO postulates: M (Multiplicity), NT (Non-Degeneracy)
  FOUR derived lemmas:
    L_loc  : A1 + M + NT  -> locality / enforcement factorization
    L_nc   : A1 + L_loc   -> non-closure under composition
    L_irr  : A1 + L_nc    -> irreversibility / record-lock
    L_col  : A1 + L_irr   -> collapse / bounded refinement

  All former axiom references (A2, A3, A4, A5) are replaced by
  their derived lemma equivalents (L_nc, L_loc, L_irr, L_col).
  Every dependency now traces to A1 alone.

TIER 0: Axiom-Level Foundations (T0, T1, T2, T3, L_epsilon*, T_epsilon,
        T_eta, T_kappa, T_M, T_Hermitian, L_irr, L_loc, L_equip)
TIER 1: Gauge Group Selection (T4, T5, T_gauge)
TIER 2: Particle Content (T_channels, T7, T_field, T4E, T4F, T4G, T9)
TIER 3: Continuous Constants / RG (T6, T6B, T19-T27, T_sin2theta)
TIER 4: Gravity & Dark Sector
TIER 5: Delta_geo Closure

v4.0.0: SINGLE-AXIOM REDUCTION.  All dependencies now reference the
  1-axiom derivation chain from Paper 61.  A2->L_nc, A3->L_loc,
  A4->L_irr throughout.  Annotated dependency strings cleaned to
  parseable IDs.  Docstrings updated to match.

v3.8.0: Added L_equip, T_tensor, T_CPTP, expanded gravity tier.
v3.6.1: Added L_irr and L_loc (single-axiom reduction lemmas).
v3.2.1: Added L_epsilon* (Minimum Enforceable Distinction).

Each theorem exports a check() -> dict with:
    name, passed, epistemic, summary, tier, dependencies, key_result

    DERIVED LEMMA (formerly axiom A2).

    CLAIM: A1 (finite capacity) + L_loc (enforcement factorization)
           ==> non-closure under composition.

    With enforcement factorized across interfaces (L_loc) and each
    interface having finite capacity (A1), individually admissible
    distinctions sharing a cut-set can exceed local budgets when
    composed.  Admissible sets are therefore not closed under
    composition.

    PROOF: Constructive witness on finite capacity budget.
    Let C = 10 (total capacity), E_1 = 6, E_2 = 6.
    Each is admissible (E_i <= C). But E_1 + E_2 = 12 > 10 = C.
    The composition exceeds capacity -> not admissible.

    This is the engine behind competition, saturation, and selection:
    sectors cannot all enforce simultaneously -> they must compete.

        (1) Any correlation between d1 and d2 requires both to exist
            as enforceable distinctions. (Definitional.)
        
        (2) T_M (monogamy): each distinction d participates in at most one
            independent correlation.
        
        (3) The correlation draws from d1's capacity budget.
            By A1: d1's total enforcement budget <= C_i at its anchor.
            d1 must allocate >= epsilon to its own existence.
            d1 must allocate >= eta to the correlation with d2.

    FULL PROOF (upgraded from sketch):
    
    Theorem: kappa = 2 is the unique enforcement multiplier consistent 
    with L_irr (irreversibility) + L_nc (non-closure).
    
    Proof of >= 2 (lower bound):
        (1) L_nc requires FORWARD enforcement: without active stabilization,
            distinctions collapse (non-closure = the environment's default 
            tendency is to merge/erase). This costs >= epsilon per distinction (T_epsilon).
            Call this commitment C_fwd.
        
        (2) L_irr requires BACKWARD verification: records persist, meaning 
            the system can verify at any later time that a record was made.
            Verification requires its own commitment -- you can't verify a
            record using only the record itself (that's circular). The
            verification trace must be independent of the creation trace,
            or else erasing one erases both -> records don't persist.
            This costs >= epsilon per distinction (T_epsilon). Call this C_bwd.
        
        (3) C_fwd and C_bwd are INDEPENDENT commitments:
            Suppose C_bwd could be derived from C_fwd. Then:
            - Removing C_fwd removes both forward enforcement AND verification.
            - But L_irr says the RECORD persists even if enforcement stops
              (records are permanent, not maintained).
            - If verification depends on forward enforcement, then when
              forward enforcement resources are reallocated (admissible
              under A1 -- capacity can be reassigned), the record becomes
              unverifiable -> effectively erased -> contradicts L_irr.
            Therefore C_bwd _|_ C_fwd.
        
        (4) Total per-distinction cost >= C_fwd + C_bwd >= 2*epsilon.
            So >= 2.
    
    Proof of <= 2 (upper bound, minimality):
        (5) A1 (finite capacity) + principle of sufficient enforcement:
            the system allocates exactly the minimum needed to satisfy
            both L_irr and L_nc. Two independent epsilon-commitments suffice:
            one for stability, one for verifiability. No third independent
            obligation is forced by any axiom or lemma.
        
        (6) A third commitment would require a third INDEPENDENT reason
            to commit capacity. The only lemmas that generate commitment
            obligations are L_irr (verification) and L_nc (stabilization).
            A1 (capacity) constrains but doesn't generate obligations.
            L_nc (non-commutativity) creates structure but not per-direction
            costs. L_loc (factorization) decomposes but doesn't add.
            Two generators -> two independent commitments -> <= 2.

        Anchor set anc(O): the set of interfaces where obligation O draws 
        enforcement capacity. (From A1: each obligation requires capacity 
        at specific interfaces.)
    
    Proof (, disjoint -> independent):
        (1) Suppose anc(O1) cap anc(O2) = empty.
        (2) By L_loc (factorization): subsystems with disjoint interface 
            sets have independent capacity budgets. Formally: if S1 and S2 
            are subsystems with I(S1) cap I(S2) = empty, then the state space 
            factors: Omega(S1 cup S2) = Omega(S1) x Omega(S2).
        (3) O1's enforcement actions draw only from anc(O1) budgets.
            O2's enforcement actions draw only from anc(O2) budgets.
            Since these budget pools are disjoint, neither can affect 
            the other. Therefore O1 and O2 are independent.  QED
    
    Proof (=>, independent -> disjoint):
        (4) Suppose anc(O1) cap anc(O2) != empty. Let i in anc(O1) cap anc(O2).
        (5) By A1: interface i has finite capacity C_i.
        (6) O1 requires >= epsilon of C_i (from L_epsilon*: meaningful enforcement 
            costs >= eps > 0). O_2 requires >= of C_i.
        (7) Total demand at i: >= 2*epsilon. But C_i is finite.
        (8) If O1 increases its demand at i, O2's available capacity 
            at i decreases (budget competition). This is a detectable 
            correlation between O1 and O2: changing O1's state affects 
            O_2's available resources.
        (9) Detectable correlation = not independent (by definition of 
            independence: O1's state doesn't affect O2's state).
            Therefore O1 and O2 are NOT independent.  QED
    
    Corollary (monogamy degree bound):
        At interface i with capacity C_i, the maximum number of 
        independent obligations that can anchor at i is:
            n_max(i) = floor(C_i / epsilon)
        If C_i = epsilon (minimum viable interface), then n_max = 1:
        exactly one independent obligation per anchor. This is the 
        "monogamy" condition.
    
    Note: The bipartite matching structure (obligations anchors with 
    degree-1 constraint at saturation) is the origin of gauge-matter 
    duality in the particle sector.

    """L_irr: Irreversibility from Finite Capacity.

    CLAIM: A1 (finite capacity) + L_nc (non-closure) ==> A4 (irreversibility).

    PROOF (5 steps):

    Step 1 -- Non-additivity is forced.
        L_nc gives non-closure: exists admissible S1, S2 with S1 union S2 inadmissible.
        This requires Delta(S1, S2) > 0 at some interface (superadditivity).

    Step 2 -- Non-additivity forces path dependence.
        If E is non-additive, the cost of adding distinction d to set S
        depends on what is already in S (context-dependence):
            m(d | S) := E(S union {d}) - E(S)
        Non-additivity ==> exists d, S1 != S2 with m(d|S1) != m(d|S2).

    Step 3 -- Path dependence forces records.
        If adding d to S commits enforcement that cannot be recovered
        (because recovering it requires traversing an inadmissible state),
        then d becomes a record: a persistent enforcement commitment.

    Step 4 -- Records force irreversibility.
        If r is a record in S, the transition {} -> S has no admissible
        inverse (removing r requires passing through inadmissible states).

    Step 5 -- Irreversibility is generic.
        The only escape is exact additivity (Delta = 0 everywhere), but L_nc
        excludes this. Countermodel: additive worlds ARE reversible.

    CLAIM: A1 (finite capacity) + M (multiplicity) + NT (non-triviality)
           ==> A3 (locality / enforcement decomposition over interfaces).

    PROOF (4 steps):

    Step 1 -- Single-interface capacity bound.
        A1: C < infinity. L_epsilon*: each independent distinction costs >= epsilon > 0.
        A single interface can enforce at most floor(C/epsilon) distinctions.

    Step 2 -- Richness exceeds single-interface capacity.
        M + NT: the number of independently meaningful distinctions
        N_phys exceeds any single interface's capacity: N_phys > floor(C_max/epsilon).

    Step 3 -- Distribution is forced.
        N_phys > floor(C_max/epsilon) ==> no single interface can enforce all
        distinctions. Enforcement MUST distribute over >= 2 independent loci.

    Step 4 -- Interface independence IS locality.
        Multiple interfaces with independent budgets means:
        (a) No interface has global access (each enforces a subset).
        (b) Enforcement demand decomposes over interfaces.
        (c) Subsystems at disjoint interfaces are independent.
        This IS A3 (locality).

    NO CIRCULARITY:
        L_loc uses only A1 + M + NT (not L_nc, not A3).
        Then L_nc uses A1 + A3 (= L_loc).
        Then L_irr uses A1 + L_nc.

    STATEMENT: At the causal horizon (Bekenstein saturation), each capacity
    unit contributes equally to âŸ¨T_Î¼Î½âŸ©, so Î©_sector = |sector| / C_total.

    PROOF (4 steps, all from [P] theorems):

    Step 1 (A4 + T_entropy [P]):
      Irreversibility â†’ entropy increases monotonically.
      At the causal horizon (outermost enforceable boundary), entropy
      is maximized: Ï_horizon = argmax S(Ï) subject to Î£Îµ_i = C.

    Step 2 (L_Îµ* [P]):
      Each distinction costs Îµ_i â‰¥ Îµ > 0 (minimum enforcement cost).
      Distinctions are discrete: C_total = âŒŠC/ÎµâŒ‹ units.
      Total capacity C = C_totalÂ·Îµ + r, where 0 â‰¤ r < Îµ.

    Step 3 (T_entropy [P] â€” Lagrange multiplier / max-entropy):
      Maximize S = -Î£ p_i ln p_i subject to Î£Îµ_i = C and Îµ_i â‰¥ Îµ.
      Unique solution (by strict concavity of S): Îµ_i = C/C_total for all i.
      That is, max-entropy distributes any surplus uniformly.
      This is standard: microcanonical ensemble over discrete states.

    Step 4 (Ratio independence):
      With Îµ_i = C/C_total for all i:
        E_sector = |sector| Ã— (C/C_total)
        Î©_sector = E_sector / E_total = |sector| / C_total
      The result is INDEPENDENT of C, Îµ, and the surplus r.

    DERIVATION:
      (1) L_irr + T_particle -> Phi=0 unstable (unbroken vacuum inadmissible:
          massless gauge bosons destabilize records)
      (2) A1 + T_gauge -> Phi->inf inadmissible (capacity saturates)

      Position-space propagator in d=3 spatial dims is G(r) ~ 1/r,
      NOT 1/r^2 (which is the field strength |E|, not the potential).
      The scan's "1/v Coulomb" used 1/r^2 in error (correct for d=4 spatial).
      
      -> The 1/v^2 form IS the correct 3+1D Coulomb/Yukawa result.
      -> The 1/v form has no physical justification in d=3+1.
    
    WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED:
      - Absolute mass value (requires T10 UV bridge -> open_physics)
      - Specific m_H = 125 GeV (witness scan, not derivation)
      - The 0.4% match is remarkable but depends on the bridge formula
        and FBC geo model -- both structural but with O(1) uncertainties
    
    FALSIFIABILITY:
      F_Higgs_1: All admissible non-linear screening -> massive scalar.
                 If no Higgs existed, the framework fails.
      F_Higgs_2: Linear screening eliminated. If justified, framework has a problem.
      F_Higgs_3: All viable models give v* > 0.5 (strongly broken vacuum).

    DERIVATION OF gamma_2/gamma_1 = d + 1/d:
    
      Let F(d) be the per-channel enforcement cost function.
      
      Theorem A: F(d) = d  [R1 independence + R2 additivity + F(1)=1 unit choice]
        d independent channels each costing F(1)=1 -> total F(d) = d*F(1) = d.
        F(1)=1 is a UNIT CHOICE (like c=1 in relativity), not physics.
      
      Theorem B: F(1/d) = 1/d  [R3 refinement covariance]
        Cost must be covariant under refinement d -> 1/d (chart covariance).
        Since F is linear: F(1/d) = (1/d)*F(1) = 1/d.
      
      Theorem C: gamma_2/gamma_1 = F(d) + F(1/d) = d + 1/d  [R4 non-cancellation]
        The RATIO gamma_2/gamma_1 receives two contributions:
          * Forward: d channels in SU(2) vs 1 in U(1) -> factor d
          * Reciprocal: refinement covariance contributes 1/d
        R4 (irreversible costs don't cancel) -> both terms ADD.
      
      NORMALIZATION NOTE: The formula d + 1/d gives the RATIO gamma_2/gamma_1
      directly, NOT gamma_2 and gamma_1 separately. It would be WRONG to compute
      gamma_1 = F(1) + F(1) = 2 and gamma_2 = F(d) + F(1/d) = d + 1/d, then
      divide. The d+1/d formula IS the ratio: it measures the SU(2)
      sector's enforcement cost RELATIVE to U(1)'s unit cost.
      
      Proof: U(1) has d_1 = 1 channel. Its cost defines the unit: gamma_1 == 1.
      SU(2) has d_2 = d channels. Its cost ratio to U(1) is:
        gamma_2/gamma_1 = [direct channels] + [reciprocal refinement] = d + 1/d
      The U(1) sector has NO reciprocal term because 1/d_1 = 1/1 = 1 = d_1.

    """T12: Dark Matter from Capacity Stratification.

    Dark matter is not a new particle species. It is a STRATUM of locally
    committed, gauge-singlet capacity that discharges through gravitational
    interfaces only.

    CORE ARGUMENT:
      Gauge interactions and gravity couple to DIFFERENT SCOPE INTERFACES.
      - Gauge fields couple only to correlations with nontrivial G_SM
        quantum numbers (internal automorphism structure).
      - Gravity couples to TOTAL locally committed correlation load,
        independent of internal structure (T9_grav: G_munu sources T_munu).

      Therefore local capacity decomposes:
        C_local = C_gauge + C_singlet

      Both gravitate. Only C_gauge interacts electromagnetically.
      C_singlet is dark matter.

    STEP 1 -- Global/Local partition [P]:
      C_total = C_global + C_local (logical dichotomy: attributable to
      a finite interface or not). T11 identifies C_global with Lambda.

    STEP 2 -- Local stratification by interface scope [P]:
      Gauge coupling requires nontrivial Aut*(A) action (T3).
      Gravity requires total non-factorization load (T9_grav).
      These are different criteria -> C_local = C_gauge + C_singlet.

    STEP 3 -- Existence of C_singlet > 0 [P_structural | R12.0]:
      The local algebra admits enforceable correlations that are G_SM
      singlets. Under R12.0 (no superselection restricting to gauge-
      charged subspace), realized states generically populate singlet
      strata. This is an EXISTENCE claim, not a particle claim.

    STEP 4 -- Properties:
      (a) Gravitates [P]: all locally committed capacity sources curvature.
      (b) Gauge-dark [P]: trivial G_SM rep -> no EM coupling.
      (c) Long-lived [P_structural]: rerouting to gauge channels costs
          additional enforcement; no generic admissible decay path.
      (d) Clusters [P_structural]: locally committed capacity follows
          gravitational gradients.
      (e) Collisionless at leading order [P_structural]: no short-range
          interaction channels beyond gravity.

    REGIME ASSUMPTIONS (NOT axioms):
      R12.0: No superselection onto gauge-charged subspace.
      R12.1: Linear enforcement cost scaling (modeling proxy).
      R12.2: Capacity-efficient realization (selection principle).

    WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED:
      - A unique particle identity for DM
      - A sharp numerical prediction of Omega_DM
      - Small-scale structure predictions
      - Sub-leading self-interaction details

    DERIVATION (Paper 3 _4.1-4.2):
    1. Enforcement capacity localizes at interfaces (locality of enforcement)
    2. If interface decomposes into subinterfaces {Gamma_alpha}, capacity is additive:
