# OBSERVATION: β-Function / Cosmology Connection

**Status:** Observed structural identity. NOT a theorem. Recorded for future investigation.

**Date:** February 8, 2026

## The Identity

The SM one-loop β-coefficients (b₁ = 41/10, b₂ = −19/6, b₃ = −7) encode the
cosmological energy budget through:

| Formula | Value | Cosmological meaning |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| −6b₂ | 19 | C_matter (Ω_m denominator) |
| 6\|b₃\| | 42 | C_Λ (dark energy capacity) |
| −6b₂ + 6\|b₃\| | 61 | C_total (all SM DOF) |

Consequently:

**b₂/b₃ = 19/42 = Ω_m/Ω_Λ** (predicted 0.4524, observed 0.4516, error 0.18%)

## Why N_gen = 3

Each identity, treated as an equation in N_gen, independently yields N = 3:

| Condition | Equation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| −6b₂(N) = C_matter(N) | 43 − 8N = 6N + 1 → 42 = 14N | N = 3 |
| 6\|b₃(N)\| = C_Λ(N) | 66 − 8N = 9N + 15 → 51 = 17N | N = 3 |
| Sum = C_total(N) | 109 − 16N = 15N + 16 → 93 = 31N | N = 3 |

These are **independent**: Condition 1 uses b₂ (SU(2) + Higgs), Condition 2 uses
b₃ (SU(3), no Higgs). They share only the fermion term 4N/3.

For all other values of N_gen, the identities **fail** (verified N = 1 through 5).

## What's Proven

- β-coefficients correctly derived from SM field content ✓
- Algebraic identities hold if and only if N_gen = 3 ✓
- Three independent equations, same solution ✓

## What's NOT Proven

- Why −6b₂ should equal C_matter (no axiom-level derivation)
- Whether the factor 6 has structural meaning or is LCD arithmetic
- Whether this follows from A1–A5 or is accidental

## Significance (if structural)

- Second independent derivation of N_gen = 3 (complementing T4F capacity saturation)
- Connects gauge running to cosmological composition
- Suggests capacity budget and RG running are two views of same structure

## Recommendation

Do NOT integrate into engine until axiom-level connection established.
The three-way N = 3 coincidence is too striking to ignore but too
ungrounded to claim as derived.
